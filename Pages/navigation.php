// This page is not meant for the user to actually see and is jsut for us programmers to easily navigate through the pages
//    This applies the most to the admin page where there is no login as there would normally be no way to access it.
//     The administrator would be the only ones that would even know how to access the page
//In short, navigation page just exists for the programmers
